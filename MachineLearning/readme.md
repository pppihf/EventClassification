使用Bayes中的MultinomialNB分布实现多分类任务
```
MNB支持TF-IDF.如下：
The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts. However, in practice, fractional counts such as tf-idf may also work.
